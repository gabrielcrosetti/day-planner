## Summary 

A website made to use as a planner for daily tasks and activities. When the website is loaded, the user is shown the current date and time at the top of the page. Below the user will find eight time blocks from 9:00am-5:00pm where they are able to enter their custom input and save it. Once the input has been saved it will stay displayed on the page after it is refreshed and until the input is changed and saved again.
